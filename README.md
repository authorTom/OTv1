# Toms Game Console Project
## Aim
### Over the years I have enjoyed tinkering with various pieces of computer hardware and software. Gaming has always been a passion, but what truly fascinated me is the technology and innovations powering the gaming experience. The objectives of this project are to design and build a fully functional game console. Designing and building my own games console will be a practical way for me to learn about hardware and software development (this is something I have always wanted to pursue)

### This journey will take me into the unknown. There is a lot I want to achieve, as my knowledge grows so will the boundaries and limitations of this project. The learning curve will be steep, and I expect to encounter many a challenge and problem that will need solving. What is even more exciting is being able to share this journey with you.
