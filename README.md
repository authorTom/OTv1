# Toms Game Console Project
## Aim
Over the years I have enjoyed tinkering and playing with computer components and devices. Gaming has always been a passion, but what truly fascinated me is the technology and innovations powering the gaming experience. The aims of this project are to design and build a fully functional game console. Designing and building a game console will be a practical way for me to learn about: product, hardware and software development. Making a physical product has been something I have always wanted to pursue.

This journey will take me into the unknown. There is a lot I want to achieve, as my knowledge grows so will the boundaries and limitations of this project. The learning curve will be steep, and I expect to encounter many a challenge and problem that will need solving. What is even more exciting is being able to share this journey with you.
