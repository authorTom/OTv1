# Toms Game Console Project
## Aim
This project is my attempt at designing and building a fully functioning game console. Over the years I have enjoyed tinkering and playing with computer components and devices. Gaming has always been a passion, but what fascinated me is the technology and innovations powering the gaming experience.

Developing a game console will be a practical way for me to learn about product, hardware and software development. Building a hardware device has been something I have always wanted to do.
